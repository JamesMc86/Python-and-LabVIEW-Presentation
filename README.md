# Python vs LabVIEW: Why Not Both?

This repo contains the code demos for my Python vs LabVIEW presentation at NI Connect 2022

Here you will find 3 demonstrations in the sub folders.

## OpenCV and LabVIEW

This demo calls out to python to run OpenCV processing against an image captured in LabVIEW. You can run this with a demo image or a webcam.

## LabVIEW DLL

This project contains a LabVIEW project that builds a DLL that can then be called from the python script.

## TCP Communications

This contains a python script which can replace the LabVIEW client in the LabVIEW shipping example for Simple TCP.

# Wiresmith Technology

This was created by Wiresmith Technology for demostration purposes. If you need help with your LabVIEW integration, find us at www.wiresmithtech.com and get in touch.
